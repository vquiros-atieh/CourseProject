# 1) Overview
Accio Songs is a search engine tool tailored to musically inclined individuals. This tool allows for query by Track, Artist, or Album. Once a track is selected from the results, the track page is displayed with additional information provided.

# 2) Implementation

Accio Songs is implemented using Flask, Python, and HTML. The webpages use a combination of HTML, Javascript, and CSS. The search results are powered by a deployment of Elastic App Search which work with various API clients to provide the queried data.

- Host search engine on a cloud service.
- Add query by Lyric
- Embed music videos
- Embed track streaming
